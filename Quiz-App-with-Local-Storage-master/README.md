# Quiz-App-with-Local-Storage
One of my assignment during Saylani Mass Training Program.

This is a simple Quiz App using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
I have tried to utilize my current skills in a bestest way. 
I also have tried to build an attracting user interface.
The app consists of 7 major parts:
1) Registration (using Local Storage)
2) Authentication (using Local Storage)
3) Quiz Panel having options for user to choose catagory and the test. (e.g. HTML5, CSS3 etc and test 1, test 2 etc)
4) Test Activation code. For security purpose. Only the authenticated person knows the test activation code. (e.g. Invigilator)
5) Instructions before test start.
6) Test in which each question consists of 4 options in which any one of the option is compulsory to mark.
7) Test Result
